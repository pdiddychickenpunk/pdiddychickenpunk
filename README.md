### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

Hi! My name is Paul. I am excited to be on this journey in Computer Science. My passion in this field comes from
building things and solving problems, it is simply the best! I enjoy working on any application, but I have had great enjoyment
in building features for websites and web apps.

# Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and listening to music. I have always been a reader and enjoy having
a physical paper book to read. I am a big heavy-metal/punk-rock fan, while also enjoying classical music! I know, quite the
contrast.
